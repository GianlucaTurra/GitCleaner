# GitCleaner

A simple TUI tool, developed with golang's BubbleTea library, to manage local
git branches not present in the remote repository.  
Performs `git fetch -p` at startup to ensure the refs are up to date.
**Breware that no confirmation is asked to perform the git commands**.

## Honest disclaimer

This is a fancy leaning project to mimic one of the functionalities of
[LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).
